<!--    needs to be changed on a per test run/test case basis, because we could define multiple tests with multiple own
        browser definitions and set setUp() as @BeforeTest instead of @BeforeSuite,
        but for that the setDriver() in setUp() in FW needs to be called multiple times,
        which goes against the static WebDriver declaration and will result in an expected exception
        solution could be to create multiple instances of FW, but that would go against the single root FW structure,
        where each test can work off of the same WebDriver instance and toolset implemented in the FW class - Catch 22
